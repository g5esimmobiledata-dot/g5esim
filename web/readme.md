# eSIM Marketplace Platform

## Overview
This project is a full-stack eSIM marketplace enabling customers to discover, purchase, and manage international eSIM data packages. It integrates with multiple eSIM providers (Airalo, eSIM Access, eSIM Go) for diverse package options. The platform includes customer-facing features and a comprehensive administrative dashboard, focusing on seamless global connectivity, intelligent multi-provider routing, automated price comparison, and a robust, scalable backend. The business aims for a significant market share through competitive pricing, superior UX, and advanced automation.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend employs a mobile-first, responsive design with light and dark modes, using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui. `react-helmet-async` is used for SEO.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for server state.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, `express-session` for session-based authentication. Drizzle ORM interfaces with a Neon serverless PostgreSQL database. Authentication is OTP-based for customers and email/password for administrators. RESTful APIs handle file uploads via Multer.
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM manages the Neon PostgreSQL database. Key tables include `users`, `admins`, `destinations`, `orders`, `providers`, and `unified_packages`. UUIDs are used for primary keys.

### Feature Specifications
- **Multi-Provider Integration**: A unified abstraction layer integrates Airalo, eSIM Access, and eSIM Go via a Provider Factory. A `unified_packages` catalog aggregates offerings with automated price comparison and "best-price" tags. A Multi-Provider Sync Scheduler manages periodic package synchronization. Packages can be automatically enabled/disabled via "Auto Mode" or managed manually by an admin.
- **Admin Panel**: Provides analytics, platform settings (pricing margins, SMTP, provider configuration), full CRUD for policy pages, CSV export, KYC, management of orders, customers, eSIMs, top-ups, API documentation, and provider management.
- **Customer Features**: Includes OTP authentication, browsing and filtering eSIM packages, order placement with automatic provider routing, account management, order history, activation guides, real-time data usage, in-app top-ups, and a support ticket system.
- **eSIM Order & Management**: Supports synchronous and asynchronous order processing across providers, managed by the ProviderFactory, with background polling for status updates.
- **Notification Systems**: Integrates with Airalo's Notification API for low data/expiring eSIM alerts and includes an in-app notification system with a Customer Notifications Page and a NotificationBell component. Admins can send custom notifications.
- **Email Template Management**: Database-backed system for customizable email templates with dynamic variable replacement.
- **Currency Management System**: Tracks conversion rates, provides an Admin UI for currency management, and supports server-side price conversion.
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support (English, Spanish, French) via a TranslationContext with fallback and parameter interpolation.
- **Enterprise Module**: B2B eSIM provisioning system for bulk orders, including multi-account management, quote generation, automated order execution, a comprehensive admin UI, and a customer portal with secure login, order tracking, and concurrency-safe eSIM distribution.
